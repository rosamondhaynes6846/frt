from what i believe realms only work in the latest version of minecraft (full release) so your looking at mods. i also believe u can only use client side mods but that might not be right. also you need a lot of ram to run mod packs, rl craft is way to demanding for a minecraft realm. you could try adding data packs for a non vanilla experience, otherwise a server is your best .  · Icy Barren Of Light: Spoiler (click to show) There are three biomes in this mod, one for each realm, the Shadowlands, the Thunderplains, and the Icy Barren Of Light. Now! The Shadowlands are made of shadow essence blocks, black concrete powder, and coal blocks. Shadow ore is also more common there. The Thunderplains are made of yellow concrete .  · Like, Subscribe, and hit that bell to stay tuned for more future content!!
