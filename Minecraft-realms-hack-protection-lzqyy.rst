 · *Disclosure* There is no % way to disable admin commands in realms survival mode as the owner. However, this is a method to make it impossible to change g.  · TIP 1. PLUGINS. Plugins are very good ways to protect from hackers. Plugins can protect from most hacks such as flying, speed hacks, and jump hacks. When hackers join protected servers alot of them leave besides the pvp s:  Minecraft realms hacking. Seems like you might have a RAT installed onto your PC. Make sure you have a proper Anti-Virus installed like Eset-Nod Smart Securtity with some real time protection. Oh that sounds like a good idea, the thing is they’ve only showed control on minecraft.
