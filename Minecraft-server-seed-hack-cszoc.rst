 · Kaptainwutax(original mod author): mod: :ht.  · You can find the seed of a single-player Java Edition Minecraft world by opening the command console and typing “/seed”. The command may not work if you do not enable cheats so that you can access the command line first. When you use this, the numeric code for your particular world will appear in your chat window immediately. There are seed crackers out there that take the location of certain structures like end cities and the height of the end pillars in order to find a bunch of suitable seeds. I find it works well enough in vanilla worlds, but I've found if the server is in Paper or whatever, it slightly changes the world generation just enough so the seed is no longer the same.
