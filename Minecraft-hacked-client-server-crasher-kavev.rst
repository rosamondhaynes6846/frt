People can use hacked clients to crash my server.: admincraft 0 Posted by u/fisher 5 years ago People can use hacked clients to crash my server. Hey, I need some help as people are able to use hacked clients to crash my server. One client, called "Sphere", i was able to crash my server with a "boxer" exploit. Is there a patch for this?  · · A Hacked Client has a "Server Crash" function implemented, which spams "CUSTOM_PAYLOAD"-Packets (using minecraft's book channels) with max size. The NCP packet frequency check doesn't block it, because it doesn't spam that much packets, but really big ones. This makes the server lag really hard and finally crash. by SHEEEEEEP. Can destroy servers with immense lag and destruction. Share on.
