The Impact client is an advanced utility mod for Minecraft, it is packaged with Baritone and includes a large number of useful mods. You can view a list of past and upcoming changes here. The list of features and modules can be found here.. Proudly built . Rusherhack. $20 + $ for rusherhack+. The best client for non-pvpers. Has the best elytra fly on 2b2t and usually is the first client to come out with bypasses for 2b2t. This client has amazingly fast support. Pyro Client. $ Developed by the Creator of SalHack but is currently dead. Impact has been known to not be safe to use. I would highly suggest using another hack. I used it on some servers with 8 accounts at the same time and it worked just fine. I use auto eat, and a pickaxe and then just choose what I want to mine with that I can have stacks of diamonds in just a few minutes.
