Realms Plus gives you instant access to a curated catalog of + Marketplace packs that everyone on your Realm can enjoy for free, with fresh content added every month. Visit Minecraft Marketplace in your Minecraft game client to purchase a Realms for Bedrock Edition or Realms Plus subscription, or simply select Create on Realms when starting. Minecraft Realms allows you to set up and administrate private worlds for a relatively low cost. The maximum cost is $ per month, supporting up to 11 concurrent players per world. The amount of players that can be given access to a Realm is far higher, but only up to 11 players can be online at any one time.
