 · Cheat Mode is a small mod that allows players to access the creative inventory from the survival mode. In general, there are two different modes that can be switched between in the config file: The open directly mode: This is set by default. When it is enabled, the creative inventory will automatically open when the player "tries" to open the survival inventory . The only exception is that if you were previously in creative it sets you to the server default gamemode instead of going back to creative. I recommend that just before you return to normal play mode, that you 1: dispose of items from creative mode that may be in your inventory or toolbar, then 2: that you move to a safe location where you won't fall or be attacked.  · MINECRAFT FORCE CREATIVE MODE SERVER HACKHope you're all having a cracking Christmas Holidays!
