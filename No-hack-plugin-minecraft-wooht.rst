 · Hacks you can use currently. FORCEFIELD_PLAYER - Forcefield, but targets only players. Each time minecraft is updated. This plugin will need to be updated as it does nms calls. If you don't know what that means. Don't worry. It just means I'm not using the bukkit API in some cases.5/5(3). Vanillium is a Vanilla Anarchy server with a mere two rules. No hack clients/xray, and no lag machines. All else goes as there are absolutely no other rules. Vanillium also has no queue, no lag, no in-game purchases, and no icky voting rewards. Just pure vanilla experience!  · About PlugHack. PlugHack is a plugin that imitates hack clients modules/hacks. Though with hack clients you have to worry about downloading viruses. Though with plugins they cant hurt your computer due to limitations set by Spigot! Commands. /scaffold: Automatically places blocks below you to mimic god bridging.5/5(4).
